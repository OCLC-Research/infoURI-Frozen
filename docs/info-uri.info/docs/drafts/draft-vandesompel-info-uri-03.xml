<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
This document defines the "info" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
scheme for information assets that have identifiers in public 
namespaces but are not part of the URI allocation. By information 
asset this document intends any information construct
that has identity within a public namespace. 
</t>

<section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
<t>
In this document the keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL 
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "MAY NOT" are to be 
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/> and indicate 
requirement levels for compliant implementations.  
</t>
</section>

<section title="Information Assets" anchor="information assets">
<t>
There exist many information assets with identifiers in public 
namespaces that are not referenceable by URI schemes. Examples of 
such namespaces include Dewey Decimal Classifications <xref target="DEWEY"/>, 
Library of Congress Control Numbers <xref target="LCCN"/>, NISO Serial Item and 
Contribution Identifiers <xref target="SICI"/>, NASA Astrophysics Data System 
Bibcodes <xref target="BIBCODE"/>, and National Library of Medicine PubMed 
identifiers <xref target="PMID"/>. Other candidate namespaces include Publisher Item 
Identifiers <xref target="PII"/>, Online Computer Library Center OCLC Numbers 
<xref target="OCLCNUM"/>, and NISO OpenURL Framework identifiers <xref target="OFI"/>.  
</t>
<t>
The "info" URI scheme facilitates the referencing of information 
assets that have identifiers in such public namespaces by means of 
URIs. When referencing an information asset by means of its "info" 
URI, the asset SHALL be considered a "resource" as defined in RFC 
2396 <xref target="RFC2396"/> and SHALL enjoy the same common syntactic, semantic 
and shared language benefits that the URI presentation confers. As 
such, the "info" URI scheme enables public namespaces that are not 
part of the URI allocation to be represented within the allocation. 
The "info" URI scheme thus provides a bridging mechanism to allow 
public namespaces to become part of the URI allocation. 
</t>
<t>
Namespaces declared under the "info" URI scheme are regulated by an 
"info" Registry mechanism. The "info" Registry allows a public 
namespace that is not part of the URI allocation to be declared in a 
registration process by the organization that manages it (the 
Namespace Authority). The "info" Registry supports the declaration of 
public namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation in a manner 
that facilitates the construction of URIs for information assets 
without imposing the burdens of independent URI registration and 
maintenance of resource representations on the Namespace Authority. 
Information assets identified within a registered namespace SHALL be 
added or deleted according to the business processes of the Namespace 
Authority, and yet MAY be referenced within network applications via 
the "info" URI in an open, standardized way without additional action 
on the part of the Namespace Authority. 
</t>
<t>
The "info" URI scheme exists primarily for identification purposes.  
Implementations MUST NOT assume that an "info" URI can be 
dereferenced to a representation of the resource identified by the 
URI although Namespace Authorities MAY disclose in the registration 
record references to service mechanisms pertaining to identifiers 
from the registered namespace. Applications of the "info" URI scheme 
are restricted to the identification of information assets and the 
declaration of normalization rules for comparing identifiers of such 
information assets regardless of whether any services relating to 
such information assets are accessible via the Internet. References 
to such services MAY be disclosed within an "info" registration 
record but these services SHALL NOT be regarded as authoritative. The 
"info" URI scheme does not support global resolution methods. 
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title='Application of the "info" URI Scheme' anchor="application">
<t> 
Public namespaces that are used for the identification of information 
assets, and that are not part of the URI allocation, MAY be 
registered as namespaces within the "info" Registry. Namespace 
Authorities MAY register these namespaces in the "info" Registry, 
thereby making these namespaces available to applications that need 
to reference information assets by means of a URI. Registrations of 
public namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation by parties 
other than the Namespace Authority SHALL NOT be permitted, thereby 
insuring against hostile usurpation or inappropriate usage of 
registered service marks or the public namespaces of others.  
</t> 
<t> 
Registration of a public namespace under the "info" Registry implies 
no particular functionalities of the identifiers from the registered 
namespace other than the identification of information assets. No 
resolution mechanisms can be assumed for the "info" URI scheme, 
though for any particular namespace there MAY exist mechanisms for 
resolving identifiers to network services. The definition of such 
services falls outside the scope of the "info" URI scheme. 
Registration does not define namespace-specific semantics for 
identifiers within a registered namespace, though allowable character 
sets and normalization rules are specified in Sections 4 and 5 so as 
to ensure that the URIs created using such identifiers are compliant 
with applications that use URIs. 
</t> 
<t> 
The registration of a public namespace in the "info" Registry SHALL 
NOT preclude further development of services associated with that 
namespace which MAY qualify the namespace for additional publication 
elsewhere within the URI allocation. 
</t> 
</section>
<section title='The "info" Registry' anchor="registry">
<t>
The "info" Registry provides a mechanism for the registration of 
public namespaces that are used for the identification of 
information assets, and that are not part of the URI allocation.  
</t> 
<t> 
NISO <xref target="NISO"/>, the National Information Standards Organization, will 
act as the Maintenance Agency for the "info" Registry, and will 
delegate the day-to-day operation of the "info" Registry to a 
Registry Operator. As the Maintenance Agency, NISO will ensure that 
the Registry Operator operates the "info" Registry in accordance with 
a publicly articulated policy document established under NISO 
governance and made available on the "info" website <eref target="http://info-uri.info/"/>.
The "info" Registry policy defines a review process for 
candidate namespaces and provides measures of quality control and 
suitability for entry of namespaces.  
</t> 
<section title='Management Characteristics of the "info" Registry' anchor="management">
<t> 
The "info" Registry will be managed according to policies established 
under the auspices of NISO. All such policies, as well as the 
namespace declarations in the "info" Registry, will be public.

<section title='Definition of "info" URI Syntax' anchor="definition">
<t> 
Note: RFC 2396, "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax" 
<xref target="RFC2396"/> is being revised <xref target="2396BIS"/> at the time of this writing. The 
syntax used in this document follows the revisions made to the 
generic URI syntax defined in RFC 2396 <xref target="2396BIS"/>. 
</t> 
<t> 
The "info" URI syntax presented in this document is generally 
conformant with the generic URI syntax defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396]. 
This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) 
notation of RFC 2234 <xref target="RFC2234"/> to define the URI. The following core 
ABNF productions are used by this specification as defined by Section 
6.1 of RFC 2234: ALPHA, DIGIT, HEXDIG. 
</t> 
<t> 
The "info" URI syntax is presented in two parts. Part A contains 
productions specific to the "info" URI scheme, while Part B contains 
generic productions from the RFC 2396 revision <xref target="2396BIS"/> which are 
repeated here both for completeness and for reference. (Although the 
work on revising RFC 2396 is currently ongoing we intend that the 
productions presented here will coincide with the final outcome of 
that work. Nevertheless this BNF is complete in itself.) The 
following set of productions (Part A) are specific to the "info" URI 
scheme: 
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf">
; Part A: 
; productions specific to the "info" URI scheme 
       
info-URI        = info-scheme ":" info-identifier [ "#" fragment ] 
    
info-scheme     = "info"  
       
info-identifier = namespace "/" identifier   
   
namespace       = scheme 
      
identifier      = *( pchar / "/" ) 
       
; Note that "info" URIs containing dot-segments (i.e. segments  
; whose full content consists of "." or "..") MAY NOT be suitable  
; for use with applications that perform dot-segment normalization 
</artwork></figure>
<t> 
This next set of productions (Part B) are generic productions 
reproduced from the RFC 2396 revision <xref target="2396BIS"/>: 
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf">
; Part B: 
; generic productions from the RFC 2396 revision [2396BIS]

pchar           = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@" 
       
fragment        = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )

                  / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=" 
</artwork></figure>
<t> 
An "info" URI has an "info-identifier" as its scheme-specific part 
and MAY take an optional "fragment" component. An "info-identifier" 
is constructed by appending an "identifier" component to a 
"namespace" component separated by a slash "/" character. The "info" 
URI scheme is supportive of hierarchical processing as indicated by 
the presence of the slash "/" character although the slash "/" 
character SHOULD NOT be interpreted as a strict hierarchy delimiter.  
</t> 
<t> 
Values for the "namespace" component of the "info" URI are name 
tokens composed of URI scheme characters only (cf. the "scheme" 
production). They identify the public namespace in which the 
(unescaped) value for the "identifier" component originates, and are 
registered in the "info" Registry, which guarantees their uniqueness 
and persistence. Although the "namespace" component is case-insensitive,
the canonical form is lowercase and documents that 
specify values for the "namespace" component SHOULD do so using 
lowercase letters. An implementation SHOULD accept uppercase letters 
as equivalent to lowercase in "namespace" names, for the sake of 
robustness, but SHOULD only generate lowercase "namespace" names, for 
consistency. 
</t> 
<t> 
Values for the "identifier" component of the "info" URI MAY be viewed 
as being hierarchical strings composed of path segments built from 
path segment characters (cf. the "pchar" production), the segments 
being separated by slash "/" characters, although any semantic 
interpretation of the "/" character as a hierarchy delimiter MUST NOT 
be assumed. In their originating public namespace, the (unescaped) 
values for the "identifier" component identify information assets. 
The values for the "identifier" component MUST be %-escaped as 
required by this syntax. The "identifier" component SHOULD be treated 
as case-sensitive, although the "info" Registry MAY record the case-sensitivity
 of identifiers from particular registered public 
namespaces. The "info" Registry MAY also disclose additional 
normalization rules regarding the treatment of punctuation characters 
and the like. 
</t> 
<t> 
Values for the "fragment" component of the "info" URI are strings 
composed of path segment characters (cf. the "pchar" production) plus 
the slash "/" character and the question-mark "?" character. No 
semantic role is assigned to the the slash "/" character and the 
question-mark "?" character within the "fragment" component. The 
(unescaped) values for the "fragment" component identify secondary 
information assets with respect to the primary information asset 
which is referenced by the "info-identifier". The values for the 
"fragment" component MUST be %-escaped as required by this syntax. 
The "fragment" component MUST be treated as being case-sensitive. 
</t> 
</section>
<section title='Allowed Characters Under the "info" URI Scheme' anchor="allowed-chars">
<t>       
The "info" URI syntax uses the same set of allowed US-ASCII 
characters as specified in RFC 2396 <xref target="RFC2396"/> for a generic URI. An 
"info" URI string SHOULD be represented as a UNICODE <xref target="UNICODE"/> string 
and be encoded in UTF-8 <xref target="RFC2279"/> form. Reserved characters as well 
as excluded US-ASCII characters and non-US-ASCII characters MUST be 
%-escaped before forming the URI. Details of the %-escape encoding 
can be found in RFC 2396, Section 2.4.

<section title='Normalization and Comparison of "info" URIs' anchor="normalization">
<t>       
In order to facilitate comparison of "info" URIs, a sequence of 
normalization steps SHOULD be applied. 
</t>       
<t>       
Since the "info" URI SHOULD be treated as being case-sensitive, a 
canonical form MAY only be arrived at by consulting the "info" 
Registry for possible information on the case-sensitivity for 
identifiers from a registered public namespace, and any case 
normalization step to apply. The "info" Registry MAY also disclose 
additional normalization rules regarding the treatment of punctuation 
characters and the like. 
</t>       
<t>       
The following generic normalization steps SHOULD be applied: 
</t>       
<figure><artwork>
     a) Normalize the case of the "scheme" component to be      
        lowercase
     b) Normalize the case of the "namespace" component to be      
        lowercase
     c) Unescape all unreserved %-escaped characters in the 
        "namespace" and "identifier" components 
     d) Normalize the case of any %-escaped characters in the 
        "namespace" and "identifier" components to be 
        uppercase 
</artwork></figure>
<t>       
The subsequent namespace-specific normalization steps MAY be applied: 
</t>       
<figure><artwork>
     e) Normalize the case of the "identifier" component as 
        per any rules that may be recorded in the Registry  
     f) Normalize any punctuation characters in the "identifier" 
        component as per any rules that may be recorded in the 
        Registry 
</artwork></figure>
<t>       
Note that "info" URIs containing dot-segments (i.e. segments whose 
full content consists of "." or "..") MAY NOT be suitable for use 
with applications that perform dot-segment normalization.

<t>       
The following unnormalized forms of an "info" URI

If the "info" Registry further records the treatment of punctuation 
characters for identifiers from the "pii" registered public namespace 
as being optional and normalized to a punctuation-free form, then the 
above URI forms can be reduced to the following unique canonical form

    N2. info:pii/S0888754302968527

<t>       
If the "info" URI includes a "fragment" component, namespace-specific 
normalization steps MUST NOT be applied to the "fragment" as 
"fragment" components are specific to the identifier, and not to the 
namespace. This means that the following two URI forms cannot be 
reconciled

<section title="Rationale" anchor="rationale">
<section title="Why Create a New URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public Namespaces?" anchor="why-create">
<t>
Under RFC 2718, "Guidelines for new URL Schemes" <xref target="RFC2718"/>, it is 
stated that a URI scheme SHOULD have a "demonstrated utility", and in 
particular SHOULD be applied to "things that cannot be referred to in 
any other way". The "info" URI scheme allows identifiers within 
public namespaces, used for the identification of information assets, 
to be referred to within the URI allocation. Once a namespace is 
registered in the "info" Registry, the "info" URI scheme enables an 
information asset with an identifier in that namespace to be 
referenced by means of a URI.  As a result, the information asset 
SHALL be considered a resource as defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396] and 
SHALL enjoy the same common syntactic, semantic and shared language 
benefits that the URI presentation confers.  
</t>
</section>    
<section title="Why Not Use an existing URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public Namespaces?" anchor="why-not-use">
<t>
Existing URI schemes are not suitable for employment as the "info" 
URI scheme admits of no global dereference mechanism. While examples 
of resource identifiers minted under other URI schemes MAY not always 
be dereferenceable, nevertheless there is always a common expectation 
that such URIs can be dereferenced by various resolution mechanisms, 
whether they be location-dependent or location-independent resource 
identifiers. The "info" URI scheme applies to a class of resource 
identifiers whose Namespace Authorities MAY or MAY NOT choose to 
disclose service mechanisms. Nevertheless, Namespace Authorities are 
encouraged to disclose in the "info" registration record references 
to any such service mechanisms in order to provide a greater utility 
to network applications. 
</t>
</section>    
<section title="Why Not Create a New URN Namespace ID for Identifiers from Public Namespaces?" anchor="why-not-create">
<t>
RFC 2141 <xref target="RFC2141"/> states that "Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are 
intended to serve as persistent, location-independent, resource 
identifiers." The "info" URI scheme, on the other hand, does not 
assert the persistence of the identifiers created under this scheme 
but rather of the public namespaces grandfathered under this scheme. 
It exists primarily to disclose the identity of information assets 
and to facilitate a lightweight registration mechanism for public 
namespaces of identifiers managed according to the policies and 
business models of the Namespace Authorities. The "info" URI scheme 
is neutral with respect to identifier persistence. Moreover, for 
"info" to operate as a URN NID would require that "info" be 
constituted as a delegated naming authority. It is not clear that a 
URN NID would be an appropriate choice for naming authority 
delegation. 
</t>           
<t>           
Further, the "info" URI scheme is not globally dereferenceable in 
contrast to the specific recommendation given in RFC 1737, 
"Functional Requirements for Uniform Resource Names" <xref target="RFC1737"/> that 
"It is strongly recommended that there be a mapping between the names 
generated by each naming authority and URLs.". Individual Namespace 
Authorities registered in the "info" Registry MAY, however, disclose 
references to service mechanisms and are encouraged to do so. 
</t>           
<t>           
An extra consideration is that the "urn" URI syntax explicitly 
excludes generic URI hierarchy by reserving the slash "/" character. 
An "info" URI, on the other hand, admits of hierarchical processing, 
while remaining neutral with respect to supporting actual hierarchy, 
and thus allows the slash "/" character (as well as more liberally 
allowing the ampersand "&amp;" and tilde "~" characters). It therefore 
represents a lower barrier to entry for Namespace Authorities in 
keeping with its intention of acting as a bridging mechanism to allow 
public namespaces to become part of the URI allocation. In sum, an 
"info" URI is more widely supportive of "human transcribability" as 
discussed in RFC 2396 <xref target="RFC2396"/> than is a "urn" URI. 
</t>           
<t>           
Additionally the "urn" URI syntax does not support "fragment" 
components as does the "info" URI syntax for indirect identification 
of secondary resources. 
</t>           
</section>    
</section>           
<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
<t>           
The "info" URI scheme syntax is subject to the same security 
considerations as the generic URI syntax described in RFC 2396 
<xref target="RFC2396"/>. 
</t>           
<t>           
While some "info" Namespace Authorities MAY choose to disclose 
service mechanisms, any security considerations resulting from the 
execution of such services fall outside the scope of this document.  
It is strongly recommended that the registration record of an "info" 
namespace include any such considerations. 
</t>           
</section>           
<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana">
<t>           
The IANA registry for URI schemes 
<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes"/> SHOULD be 
updated to include an entry for the "info" URI scheme when the "info" URI 
scheme is accepted for publication as an RFC.  This entry SHOULD
contain the following values:
</t>
<t>
<list style="hanging">       
<t hangText="Scheme Name:">info</t>
<t hangText="Description:">Information assets with identifiers in public namespaces</t>
<t hangText="Reference:">(reference to the RFC under which the "info" URI scheme is described)</t>
