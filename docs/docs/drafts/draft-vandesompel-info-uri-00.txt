  1  Introduction  
          
     This document defines the "info" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
     scheme for information assets that have identifiers in public 
     namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation. By information 
     asset this document intends any information construct – i.e. any 
     abstraction or manifestation - that has identity within a public 
     namespace. 
   
     There exist many information assets with identifiers in public 
     namespaces that are not referenceable by URI schemes. Examples of 
     such namespaces include Dewey Decimal Classifications [DEWEY], 
     Library of Congress Control Numbers [LCCN], NASA Astrophysics Data 
     System Bibcodes [BIBCODE], and Open Archives Initiative 
     identifiers [OAI].  Other possible namespaces could include 
     National Library of Medicine PubMed identifiers [PUBMED], 
     International DOI Foundation Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) 
     [DOI], Publisher Item Identifiers (PII) [PII], NISO Serial Item 
     and Contribution Identifier (SICI) codes [SICI], and NISO OpenURL 
     Framework identifiers [OFI].  
      
     The "info" URI scheme facilitates the referencing of information 
     assets that have identifiers in such public namespaces by means of 
     URIs.  When referencing an information asset by means of its 
     "info" URI, the asset SHALL be considered a "resource" as defined 
     in RFC 2396 [RFC2396]. As such, the "info" URI scheme enables 
     public namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation to 
     become part of the URI allocation. The "info" URI scheme thus 
     provides a bridging mechanism to allow public namespaces to become 
     part of the URI allocation. 
      
     Namespaces declared under the "info" URI scheme are regulated by 
     an "info" Registry mechanism.  The "info" Registry allows a public 
     namespace that is not part of the URI allocation to be declared in 
     a registration process by the organization that manages it (the 
     Namespace Authority).  The "info" Registry supports the

     declaration of public namespaces that are not part of the URI 
     allocation in a manner that facilitates the construction of URIs 
     for information assets without imposing the necessity of URI 
     maintenance on the Namespace Authority. Information assets 
     identified within a registered namespace SHALL be added or deleted 
     according to the business processes of the Namespace Authority, 
     and yet MAY be referenced within network applications via the 
     "info" URI in an open, standardized way without additional action 
     on the part of the Namespace Authority. 
      
     The "info" URI scheme explicitly decouples identification from 
     resolution.  Applications SHOULD NOT assume that an "info" URI can 
     be dereferenced to a representation of the resource identified by 
     the URI, though some business processes MAY make "info" URIs 
     resolvable either directly or conditionally. The purposes of the 
     "info" URI scheme are the identification of information assets and 
     the standardization of rules for declaring and comparing identity 
     of information assets without regard to any resolution of the URI 
     or even whether the information asset identified by the URI is 
     accessible on the Internet. 
      
  2  Terminology 
      
     In this document the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL 
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" are to be interpreted as 
     described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels 
     for compliant implementations.  
      
  3  Application of the "info" URI Scheme 
      
     Public namespaces that are used for the identification of 
     information assets, and that are not referenceable within the URI 
     allocation, MAY be registered as namespaces within the "info" 
     Registry. Namespace Authorities MAY register these namespaces in 
     the "info" URI Registry, thereby making these namespaces 
     addressable in applications that use URIs.  Registrations of 
     public namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation by 
     parties other than the Namespace Authority SHALL NOT be permitted, 
     thereby insuring against hostile usurpation or inappropriate usage 
     of registered service marks or the public namespaces of others.  
      
     Registration under the "info" Registry of a public namespace that 
     is not part of the URI allocation implies no particular 
     functionalities of the identifiers from the registered namespace 
     other than the identification of information assets within the 
     namespace being registered. There is no assurance of resolution 
     mechanisms associated with the "info" URI scheme, though for any 
     particular namespace there MAY exist mechanisms for resolving 
     identifiers to information assets. The definition of such services

     falls outside the scope of the "info" URI scheme. Registration 
     does not define namespace-specific semantics for identifiers 
     within a registered namespace, though allowable character sets and 
     normalization rules are specified in sections 5 and 6 so as to 
     ensure that the URIs created using such identifiers are compliant 
     with applications that use URIs. 
   
     The registration of a public namespace in the "info" Registry 
     SHALL NOT preclude further development of services associated with 
     that namespace which MAY qualify the namespace for additional 
     publication elsewhere within the URI allocation. 
   
  4  The "info" Registry 
      
     The "info" Registry provides a mechanism for the registration of 
     public namespaces that are used for the identification of 
     information assets, irrespective of whether such assets are 
     accessible on the Internet.  
      
     NISO [NISO], the National Information Standards Organization, will 
     act as the Maintenance Authority for the "info" Registry, and will 
     delegate the day-to-day operation of the "info" Registry to a 
     Registry Operator. As the Maintenance Agency, NISO will ensure 
     that the Registry Operator operates the "info" Registry in 
     accordance with publicly articulated policy established under NISO 
     governance and available at <http://info-uri.niso.org/info-uri-
     policy>.  The "info" Registry policy defines a review process for 
     candidate namespaces and provides measures of quality control and 
     suitability for entry of namespaces.  
   
  4.1 Management Characteristics of the "info" Registry 
      
     The "info" Registry will be managed according to policies 
     established under the auspices of NISO.  All such policies, as 
     well as the namespace declarations in the "info" Registry, will be 
     public. 
      
  4.2 Functional Characteristics of the "info" Registry 
      
     The "info" Registry will be publicly accessible and will support 
     discovery (by both humans and machines) of: 
      
         . string literals identifying the namespaces  
         . names and contact information of Namespace Authorities 
         . syntax requirement for identifiers maintained in such 
           namespaces  
         . normalization methodology for identifiers maintained in such 
           namespaces

         . if applicable, resolution mechanism, and accompanying 
           security considerations, for identifiers maintained in such 
           namespaces 
      
     where the Registry entries refer to the corresponding "namespace" 
     and "identifier" components which are defined in the ABNF given in 
     section 5.1 of this document. 
      
  4.3 Maintenance of the "info" Registry 
      
     The public namespaces that MAY be registered in the "info" 
     Registry will be those of interest to the communities served by 
     NISO and therefore NISO is committed to act as Maintenance 
     Authority for the "info" Registry, and to assign a Registry 
     Operator to operate it on a day-to-day basis. 
      
     NISO, a non-profit association accredited by the American National 
     Standards Institute (ANSI), identifies, develops, maintains, and 
     publishes technical standards to manage information in the digital 
     environment. NISO standards apply technologies to the full range 
     of information-related needs, including retrieval, re-purposing, 
     storage, metadata, and preservation. 
      
     Founded in 1939, incorporated as a not-for-profit education 
     association in 1983, and assuming its current name the following 
     year, NISO draws its support from the communities it serves. The 
     leaders of over 70 organizations in the fields of publishing, 
     libraries, IT and media serve as its voting members. Hundreds of 
     experts and practitioners serve on NISO committees and as officers 
     of the association.  
      
     NISO has been designated by ANSI to represent US interests to the 
     International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) Technical 
     Committee 46 on Information and Documentation. 
      
     The NISO headquarters office is located at: 4733 Bethesda Ave., 
     Bethesda, MD 20814, USA. 
      
  5  The "info" URI Scheme 
          
  5.1 Definition of "info" URI Syntax  
          
     The "info" URI syntax presented in this document conforms to the 
     generic URI syntax defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396]. This 
     specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation 
     of RFC 2234 [RFC2234] to define the URI. The following core ABNF 
     productions are used by this specification as defined by Section

                          The "info" URI Scheme          September 2003 
   
   
     6.1 of RFC 2234: ALPHA, DIGIT, HEXDIG. The complete URI syntax is 
     as follows: 
      
       info-uri        = info-scheme ":" info-identifier 
                                            
       info-scheme     = "info"  
      
       info-identifier = info-namespace "/" identifier 
      
       info-namespace  = ALPHA *name-char 
      
       identifier      = *path-char 
      
       name-char       = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." 
      
       path-char       = unescaped / escaped  
      
       unescaped       = ALPHA / DIGIT / 
                         "-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" / "'" / 
                         "(" / ")" / ";" / ":" / "@" / "&" / "=" / 
                         "+" / "$" / "," 
   
       escaped         = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG 
      
     An "info" URI has an "info-identifier" as its scheme-specific 
     part. An "info-identifier" is constructed by appending an 
     "identifier" component to an "info-namespace" component separated 
     by a slash "/" character. The "info" scheme is hierarchical as 
     indicated by the presence of the slash "/" character but is pruned 
     to be one level deep. 
      
     Values for the "info-namespace" component of the "info" URI are 
     name tokens composed of name characters ("name-char") only.  They 
     identify the public namespace in which the value for the 
     "identifier" component originates, and are registered in the 
     "info" Registry, which guarantees their uniqueness. Although the 
     "info-namespace" component is case-insensitive, the canonical form 
     is lowercase and documents that specify values for the "info-
     namespace" component MUST do so using lowercase letters. An 
     implementation SHOULD accept uppercase letters as equivalent to 
     lowercase in "info-namespace" names, for the sake of robustness, 
     but SHOULD only generate lowercase "info-namespace" names, for 
     consistency. 
      
     Values for the "identifier" component of the "info" URI are opaque 
     strings composed of path segment characters ("path-char").  In 
     their originating public namespace, the values for the 
     "identifier" component identify an information asset. The values 
     for the "identifier" component MUST be %-escaped, and thus display

     no visible URI structure. The "identifier" component MUST be 
     treated as case-sensitive, although the "info" Registry MAY record 
     the case-sensitivity of identifiers from within particular 
     registered public namespaces. 
      
  5.2 Allowed Characters Under the "info" URI Scheme 
      
     The "info" URI syntax uses the same set of allowed US-ASCII 
     characters as specified in RFC 2396 [RFC2396] for a generic URI. 
     Reserved characters as well as excluded US-ASCII characters and 
     non-US-ASCII characters MUST be %-escaped before forming the URI. 
     Details of the %-escape encoding can be found in RFC 2396, section 
     2.4. 
          
  5.3 Examples of "info" URIs 
          
     Some examples of syntactically valid "info" URIs are given below: 
        
       a) info:ddc/22%2Feng%2F%2F004.678 
        
     where "ddc" is the "info-namespace" component for the namespace of 
     Dewey Decimal Classifications [DEWEY] and "22%2Feng%2F%2F004.678" 
     is the "identifier" component for an identifier of an information 
     asset within that namespace in %-escaped form. In unescaped form 
     this identifier is "22/eng//004.678", i.e. the (22nd Ed.) English-
     language Dewey Decimal Classification for "Internet". 
   
       b) info:lccn/2002022641 
        
     where "lccn" is the "info-namespace" component for a Library of 
     Congress Control Number [LCCN] namespace and "2002022641" is the 
     "identifier" component for an identifier of an information asset 
     within that namespace. 
      
       c) <rdf:Description about="info:bibcode/2003Icar..163..263Z"/> 
        
     where "bibcode" is the "info-namespace" component for a NASA ADS 
     Bibcode [BIBCODE] namespace and "2003Icar..163..263Z " is the 
     "identifier" component for an identifier of an information asset 
     within that namespace. 
        
       d) info:oai/arXiv.org:hep-th%2F9901001  
        
     where "oai" is the "info-namespace" component for the namespace of 
     OAI identifiers [OAI] and "arXiv.org:hep-th%2F9901001" is the 
     "identifier" component for an identifier of an information asset 
     within that namespace in %-escaped form. In unescaped form this 
     identifier is represented using the Unicode [UNICODE] character

     set and is encoded in UTF-8 [RFC2279] as "arXiv.org:hep-
     th/9901001". 
      
  6  Normalization and Comparison of "info" URIs 
      
     In order to facilitate comparison of "info" URIs, a sequence of 
     normalization steps SHOULD be applied to minimize the amount of 
     software processing. 
      
     Since the "info" URI is case-sensitive, a canonical form MAY only 
     be arrived at by consulting the "info" Registry for possible 
     information on the case-sensitivity of identifiers from a 
     registered public namespace, and any case normalization step to 
     apply. 
      
     The following normalization steps SHOULD be applied: 
      
         a) Normalize the case of the URI scheme token to be      
            lowercase 
         b) Normalize the case of the "info-namespace" component to be      
            lowercase 
         c) Unescape all unreserved %-escaped characters 
         d) Normalize the case of any %-escaped characters to be 
            uppercase 
      
     The following unnormalized forms of an "info" URI 
      
         U1. INFO:OAI/arXiv.org:hep-th%2F9901001 
         U2. info:oai/ARXIV.ORG:hep-th%2f9901001 
         U3. info:oai/arXiv.org:hep-th%2f9901001 
         U4. info:OAI/arXiv.org%3AHEP-TH%2F9901001 
   
     are normalized to the following respective forms  
      
         N1. info:oai/arXiv.org:hep-th%2F9901001 
         N2. info:oai/ARXIV.ORG:hep-th%2F9901001 
         N3. info:oai/arXiv.org:hep-th%2F9901001 
         N4. info:oai/arXiv.org:HEP-TH%2F9901001 
   
     If the "oai" public namespace were registered in the "info" 
     Registry as being case-insensitive and normalized to a lowercase 
     form, then the above URI forms can be reduced to the following 
     unique canonical form

                          The "info" URI Scheme          September 2003 
   
   
  7.1 Why Create a New URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public 
  Namespaces? 
      
     Under RFC 2718, "Guidelines for new URL Schemes" [RFC2718], it is 
     stated that a URI scheme SHOULD have a "demonstrated utility", and 
     in particular SHOULD be applied to "things that cannot be referred 
     to in any other way". The "info" URI scheme allows identifiers 
     within registered public namespaces, used for the identification 
     of information assets, to be referred to within the URI 
     allocation. Once a namespace is registered in the "info" Registry, 
     the "info" URI scheme enables an information asset with an 
     identifier in that namespace to be referenced by means of a URI.  
     As a result, the information asset SHALL be considered a resource 
     as defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396].  
      
  7.2 Why Not Use a URN Namespace ID for Identifiers from Public 
  Namespaces? 
   
     RFC 2396 [RFC2396] states that a "URN differs from a URL in that 
     it’s primary purpose is persistent labeling of a resource with an 
     identifier". An "info" URI on the other hand does not assert 
     persistence of resource names or of the resource itself, but 
     rather declares namespaces of identifiers managed according to the 
     policies and business models of the Namespace Authorities.  Some 
     of these namespaces will not have persistence of identifiers as a 
     primary purpose, while others will have locator semantics as well 
     as name semantics. It would therefore be inappropriate to employ a 
     URN Namespace ID for such namespaces. 
      
  8  Security Considerations 
          
     The "info" URI scheme syntax is subject to the same security 
     considerations as the generic URI syntax described in RFC 2396 
     [RFC2396]. 
      
     An "info" URI provides no assurance that any resolution mechanism 
     is deployed and therefore security considerations regarding the 
     use of "info" URIs MUST be limited solely to the nature of the 
     identifier string itself. This document makes no guarantees about 
     the safety of resolving "info" URIs. Should a namespace registered 
     under the "info" scheme provide mechanisms for resolving "info" 
     URIs to information assets, an implementation MUST consult the 
     "info" Registry for any security considerations. The definition of 
     such resolution mechanisms falls outside the scope of the "info" 
     URI scheme. 
      
     If an implementation for whatever reason cannot consult the "info" 
     Registry for entries regarding a particular "info" namespace it

     MUST NOT make any assumptions regarding security arrangements for 
     that namespace beyond the nature of the identifier string itself.
